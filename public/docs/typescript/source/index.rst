Typescript 
===================

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional types, interfaces, and other features that help catch errors early and improve code quality and maintainability.

Key Features:

- **Static Typing**: Add type annotations to variables, function parameters, and return values.
- **Interfaces & Type Aliases**: Define contracts for objects and structure for data.
- **Classes & Inheritance**: Supports modern object-oriented programming.
- **Modules**: Organize code into reusable units.
- **Type Inference**: Automatically deduces types when possible.
- **Tooling Integration**: Works well with modern editors like VS Code for autocomplete and refactoring.
- **Strict Mode**: Enables a set of rules to catch more bugs early.

**Use Cases**:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Large-scale applications where maintainability is key.
- Projects where early bug detection is valuable.
- Teams looking to enforce coding standards and contracts.

Getting Started:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Install via npm: `npm install -g typescript`
- Initialize: tsc --init
- Compile: tsc
